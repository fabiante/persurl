## PURL Support

This project tries it's best to implement PURL support as it can be understood
from a couple of hours researching the topic on the web. It is possible that
some implementations deviate from what PURL was ment to do.

If you find any critical deviations or design flaws which you think should be adressed,
please open an issue to resolve that.
